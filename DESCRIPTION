Description: Symbolically caculate the moments of a normal, lognormal or gamma 
    distribution, which may be multivariate. Numerically calculate the 
    distribution or moments of the BEGG distribution. Test a one dimensional 
    distribution with compact support if it is unimodal. The test is based on 
    the moments of that distribution.
