Description: Caculate the moments of a normal, lognormal or gamma distribution
    symbolically. The distribution may be multivariate. Additionally, a method
    to numerically calculate samples or moments of the BEGG distribution are
    provided and a test for the unimodality of a one dimensional distribution
    based on the moments of that distribution.
